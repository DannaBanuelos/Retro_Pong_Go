## Description
Based on the famous Atari game `PONG`, **Retro Pong GO!** is an interactive virtual game designed for 2 players that aims to replicate the well-known sport of ping pong. Featuring eye catching colors and a creative sound design implemented with `pygame` and `pygame.mixer, in order to generate a game of healthy competition and mental strategy using digital elements.

## Design Considerations
- **Visual Format** Inspired by the classic Atari retro video game `PONG`, following the aesthetic of classic video games from past decades
- **Digital Structure** the project runs at 60 fps, with a 1000x800 Blakc canvas divided into 2 parts for each player with gray lines in the middle. 
- **Sound Design** Each interaction between the elements of the program generates an 8-bit sound in .WAV format.WAV, whether when the ball collides, a player scores points, or a level of the game is completed, a small musical theme plays to announce the final result.
- **Color Palette** Red and Blue colors were implemented to differentiate the paddles of player 1 and 2, green for the levels to keep track of the game's progress, and White for the ball and game points
