## Milestones
- Week 1
1.	Basic coding, output prints out the game window correctly, and can be open and closed
2.	The program prints the left and right paddles, the ball in the center, point counter for each player starting in 0, and the level the game Is at. 
 
- Week 2
1.	Make the ball able to move left to right, up and down through the whole game window.
2.	Paddles move up and down and can hit the ball, making it go the opposite way.
3.	A point is counted for player 1 or 2 depending on which wall the ball hits.
4.	Add different colors and designs for paddles, balls, and points/level typo.
 
- Week 3 (Final)
1.	When a player gets to 5 points, the match ends and prints out the result in the center of the game window (3s)
2.	The game continues to a new level. If 1 of the players hits 5 points first in 2 consecutive levels, the player wins; else, a third level is added, and the first player to get 5 points wins the game.
3.	Adding sound to the game when the ball hits a paddle, the wall, and when a point is added
4.	The game prints the results and gives the option to either quit or restart the game.
