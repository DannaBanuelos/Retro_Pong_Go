## Description
**Retro Pong GO!** is an interactive virtual video game aimed at recreating the activity of ping pong. ¬° Based on the famous Atari game PONG, Rtero Pong GO! Generates an interactive board, designed for 2 players, prints 2 paddles in blue and red, and a ball in the center that travels in all directions with a resolution of 60fps, creating visuals with attractive colors, emitting sounds with each movement of the graphics, and announcing the victory of a player.

## Design Considerations
- **Visual Format** Inspired by the classic Atari retro video game `PONG`, following the aesthetic of classic video games from past decades
- **Digital Structure** the project runs at 60 fps, with a 1000x800 Blakc canvas divided into 2 parts for each player with gray lines in the middle. 
- **Sound Design** Each interaction between the elements of the program generates an 8-bit sound in .WAV format.WAV, whether when the ball collides, a player scores points, or a level of the game is completed, a small musical theme plays to announce the final result.
- **Color Palette** Red and Blue colors were implemented to differentiate the paddles of player 1 and 2, green for the levels to keep track of the game's progress, and White for the ball and game points
